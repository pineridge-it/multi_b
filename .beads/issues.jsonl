Background: Connects supply (verifiers) with demand (claims needing verification). Reasoning: Structured evidence taxonomy ensures comprehensive and auditable verdicts; marketplace discovery prevents claim starvation. Justification: Bounty model allows market-determined pricing vs fixed rates; evidence hashing prevents tampering and enables offline verification.

Background: Determines 'truth' through collective verification. Reasoning: Commit-reveal prevents social proof herding; reputation weighting prioritizes expertise; bonded disputes balance appeal rights with abuse prevention.
